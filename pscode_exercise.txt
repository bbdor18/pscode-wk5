// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers
a=5
 b=5
a+b=c
 sum=10


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
INPUT n=8
   remainder=8%2
If remander is not equal to 0
   answer=odd
ELSE
   answer=even
OUTPUT=even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
START
  Take five numbers.
    ADD these five numbers and store it to sum.
      Divide sum by five and use as average.
Show sum.
  Show average.
a=1
 b=2
  c=3
   d=4
    e=5
Sum=a+b+c+d+e;
  Average=(a+b+c+d+e)/5
Sum=15
 AVG=3
  Minimum=1
   Maximum=5
